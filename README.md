This is what the form should do:

- Text field for the user to enter his API key
- a link to confirm
- once he confirm, we test it in the background and see if it accepts
- if it accepts, we show the user's usage so far ($used/$total credit)
- if the user has exceeded his usage, we should say it in red
- if the key is not valid we should tell the user
- once the key is valid, we should also display a link in case the user wants to replace that key
